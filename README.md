# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview
This project is a **Diabetes Prediction Model** that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on their medical parameters. The model uses machine learning techniques to analyze input data and provide predictions. The primary goal of this project is to assist in early detection and prevention of diabetes.

## Features
- **User Input:** Accepts input data such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a trained classification model for prediction.
- **Accuracy:** High prediction accuracy achieved through data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple and intuitive interface for both healthcare professionals and patients.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following software and packages are installed:
1. Python (>=3.7)
2. pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Dataset
The model is trained using the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age of the person (years)
- **Outcome**: 0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic

## Model Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize/standardize data.
   - Perform train-test split.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost).
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deployed using Flask (or Django) for a web-based interface.

## How to Use
1. Open the application by running the command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Enter the required medical parameters in the form provided.
3. Submit the form to view the prediction (Diabetic or Non-Diabetic).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Flask (or Django, if applicable)
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization
  - `joblib`: For saving and loading the trained model

## Results
The model achieved:
- **Accuracy:** 75% (replace with actual value)

## Future Improvements
1. Integrate more advanced machine learning algorithms like neural networks.
2. Expand the dataset to include more diverse demographics.
3. Add feature importance analysis to interpret predictions.
4. Develop a mobile-friendly interface.
